## Overview

LocusCompare2 integrates 6 popular colocalization tools:
+ SNP-level colocalization: [coloc](https://github.com/chr1swallace/coloc), [fastEnloc](https://github.com/xqwen/fastenloc), [finemap](http://christianbenner.com/)
+ Mendelian randomization: [SMR](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#Overview)
+ Transcriptomic association: [PrediXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan) and [TWAS](http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/)

It could run all the colocalization tools above, display summary report and give manhattan plot and LocusCompare plot for 
the significant SNPs and genes.
